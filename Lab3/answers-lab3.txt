1. The purpose of having an individual handler function for each exception/interrupt is that we are able to have diffent outcomes for each exception/interrupt. 

2. The reason that vector 13 is produced instead of vector 14 is because vector 14 is a kernal page fault meaning the program would just end.

3. The general protection fault would would be active if it was set to ring 0.

4. The purpose of this setup is to make sure no one intrupts the kernals processes.
